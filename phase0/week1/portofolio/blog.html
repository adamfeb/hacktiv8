          <h1>Persiapan mengikuti kelas pemrograman di Hacktiv8, Web Development Coding Bootcamp selama 3 bulan</h1>
          <h3>Coding bootcamps’ popularity is growing. It sounds like a perfect idea to fast-forward your career. But is it really something for you?</h3>
          <h4>by <span class="blogauthor">Adam Febrianata</span> pada <span class="blogdate">Senin, 25 Maret 2019</span><span class="blogcategory">Personal</span></h4>
          <p>Just a couple of years back it was perfectly normal to choose a degree and then build a career in that same field until you retired. Competencies lived separately: the IT people did the coding, the business people focused on the entrepreneurial aspects, and the accountants ran the books.</p>
          <p>If you still believe in the stereotype of a developer being that unhygienic weirdo, working from their parents’ basement — just scratch it. Although I’m sure you can still find a couple of those, the times have changed. Only the most brilliant few will get away without social skills. But the reality is that nowadays employers put a huge emphasis on soft skills when hiring new members of their tech teams.</p>
          <p>You need to be able to communicate — both with your teammates and clients, listen and collaborate. And you’ll most likely be faced with similar challenges during the bootcamp. Starting from programming in pairs, and ending with your final project — you won’t get away from teamwork.</p>
          <blockquote>"Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe"</blockquote>
          <p>But let’s make one thing clear: <span class="thick">bootcamps are not for everyone</span>. If somebody tells you otherwise they probably don’t know a lot about bootcamps or are only focused on getting your money.</p>

          <h2>Do you like to code?</h2>
          <p>This one is important, even if the bootcamp you are considering accepts complete beginners. You haven’t written a single line of code in your life? Take an online course on Codecademy, Coursera or freeCodeCamp. They all have great resources for beginners and are completely free. If you get too stuck you can use their forums to ask for help. But try not to use those forums too often: being stuck and trying to figure the problem out yourself is a part of the process. You finished your first course and still think it’s fun? That’s a great place to start.</p>
          <h2>Do you want to learn fast? And if so, can you learn fast?</h2>
          <p>If you’re considering taking a bootcamp, the answer to the first question is probably ‘yes’. But what about the second one? Be honest with yourself: think of your school years, weeks preceding exams at the university or that time when your colleague got sick and you needed to step in for them at work, even though you didn’t fully know the specifics of the job.</p>
          <p>Your background doesn’t matter. I have degrees in journalism, book design and literary criticism — and currently work as a developer and a coding tutor. It’s the mindset that matters. The rate of change in the industry means that as a developer you can never stop learning (or you will fall far behind very quickly). So ask yourself if learning is something you actually enjoy — not for the next couple of months of the bootcamp, but for the rest of your career.</p>
